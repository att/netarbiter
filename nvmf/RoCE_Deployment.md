- Switch: [Lossless RoCE Configuration for MLNX-OS Switches in PCP-Based QoS Mode](https://community.mellanox.com/docs/DOC-3018)

Lossy fabric (requires ECN)
- Adapter: [RoCE Configuration for Mellanox Adapters (PCP-Based)](https://community.mellanox.com/docs/DOC-2883)

### Tutorials
- [RoCE v2 Considerations](https://community.mellanox.com/docs/DOC-1451)
   * Difference between RoCE v1 and RoCE v2: RoCE v2 operates on UDP/IP.
   * [Resilient RoCE](https://community.mellanox.com/docs/DOC-2499) 
      - the ability to send RoCE traffic over a lossy network (a network without flow control enabled), without the need to enable flow control on the network
      - Resilient RoCE is supported on ConnectX-4/Lx adapters and onward on the hardware level.
      - It is recommended to enable RoCE congestion control (ECN) as well as PFC. However, PFC or general flow control is not a must requirement.
   * Lossless RoCE: requires PFC or global pause, but recommend PFC

- Terminology  
source: https://community.mellanox.com/docs/DOC-2321  
   * RP (Reaction Point, injector): the end node that performs rate limitation to prevent congestion
   * NP (Notification Point): the end node that receives the packets from the injector and sends back notifications to the injector for indications regarding the congestion situation
   * CP (Congestion Point): the switch queue in which congestion happens
   * CNP (The RoCEv2 Congestion Notification Packet): The notification message an NP sends to the RP when it receives CE marked packets.
